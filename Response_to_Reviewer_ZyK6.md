We sincerely appreciate your positive assessment of our work.

### R1 to Q1/W1/W2/W3 (Necessity of Edge Imputation & Studies on Diffusion and TST)：
As many studies reveal, various applications such as Remote Patient Monitoring and Wind Turbine Blade Icing Detection, desire fast data preprocessing (like imputation) and decision-making at the edge. They cannot afford the latency brought by cloud processing, and issues like network congestion and data privacy further emphasize the need for edge-resident data processing.

Besides, We added experimental results for PriSTi (diffusion-based SOTA), and ReCTSi-TST variant $\S$. PriSTi achieves better accuracy (MAE: 17.384) but at the cost of significantly lower efficiency, with 6517× FLOPs, 10× peak memory and parameter counts, and 6561× latency compared to ReCTSi. This inefficiency makes them unsuitable for edge scenarios, which is why we exclude diffusion models in the submission. Besides, ReCTSi-TST underperforms (MAE: 36.571 and FLOPs: 0.32M) relative to ReCTSi (MAE: 19.483 and FLOPs: 0.06M), indicating challenges in learning complex TST-patterns through a single module. These insights will be further discussed in the final version.
### R2 to Q2 (Advanced Attentions):
Yes, we have explored various methods to reduce the complexity of attention modules, including adopting transformer variants during ReCTSi's design. Despite these efforts, these variants led to much accuracy loss (e.g., ReCTSi-Informer adopt the attention mechanism from Informer, presents about 50% FLOPs decrease, while leading to 36% MAE accuracy loss, which is not acceptable) $\S$. Consequently, inspired by Group Conv, we developed a Grouped FFN mechanism (see Section 4.4), which has been proven to be both effective and efficient. Besides, as mentioned in the above response, the inferior accuracy of ReCTSi-TST underscored the challenge in effectively learning complex TST-patterns through a singular attention module. 
### R3 to Q3/W4 (Missing Rate Study):
To assess effectiveness and robustness, we conducted a study of the impact of varying missing rates (15%-45%) $\S$. ReCTSi demonstrated remarkable stability and superior performance, maintaining accuracy (e.g., MAE: 18.75-19.96 for PeMs-BA) across all the settings, significantly outperforming the baselines. For instance, PoGeVon, the nearest competitor, recorded higher MAE ranges (20.89-22.42 for PeMs-BA).
