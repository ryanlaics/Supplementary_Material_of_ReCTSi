### Q1 (Non-DL Methods for Small Datasets)ï¼š
We would argue that even with a limited number of timestamps, traditional non-DL methods are not necessarily superior to DL methods. This is because real-world time series data, including small datasets, often exhibit complex, nonlinear patterns without clear regularity. Non-DL methods struggle to model such complexity accurately, regardless of dataset size. Conversely, DL methods are adept at capturing intricate correlations within these challenging datasets, demonstrating their ability to effectively model and understand data dynamics, even when faced with limited samples. The experimental results in Table 2 support this observation, illustrating DL methods' superiority in handling rather small datasets.
### Q2 (Scenarios for Non-DL Methods):
We deem that in scenarios with regular, periodic, or stationary data patterns, traditional methods might perform on par with DL-based approaches due to their simplicity and direct applicability to such data characteristics. However, in the context of real-world applications characterized by complex, non-linear patterns and the need to capture intricate spatial and temporal correlations, DL-based methods, including ReCTSi, significantly outshine traditional methods. This advantage is well-documented in contemporary time-series research, where the majority of newly proposed methods leverage deep learning to address the complexities inherent in real-world data effectively.
### Q3/W2 (Generalizability):
Typically, adapting a learning-based model to a specific dataset is a fundamental step in achieving excellent performance. The theoretical guarantee of a model's effectiveness across all datasets, or even specific ones, is challenging. Nonetheless, we provide evidence that the trained ReCTSi performs admirably across diverse domains including traffic flow, air quality, and COVID-19, as shown in Tables 1 and 2 of our original submission.
### Q4 (Visualizations of CaA):
ReCTSi's attention mechanism employs Completeness Matrices to prioritize features' importances based on their completeness, effectively increasing the attention scores for segments with fewer missing values. This approach ensures the model focuses on the most informative parts of the data. To enhance understanding, we've introduced attention-score heatmaps that visually represent the distribution and adjustment of attention weights, highlighting the mechanism's ability to identify and prioritize complete data segments$^\S$.

Regarding the fine-tuned or customized for specific applications, we would argue that ReCTSi is crafted for the general CTS imputation task, demonstrating its effectiveness across various domains such as traffic, air quality, and COVID-19, as well as under different data completeness scenarios. Thus, we think there is no need of additional effort to be fine-tuned or customized for specific applications, only regular hyper-parameter tuning is required for specific applications.
### Q5 (Noisy or Irregularly Sampled Data):
Actually, our work uses real-world datasets, which naturally include noise. The focus of this study is based on the assumption of imputing observed values, hence addressing data noise falls outside our scope. Besides, denoising research often targets specific scenarios with predefined noise characteristics. Thus we suggest users apply targeted denoising techniques suited to their dataset's specific conditions before employing ReCTSi for imputation.

Besides, ReCTSi is engineered to handle both regularly and irregularly sampled datasets. For irregular sampling, adjustments include omitting the PST-pattern codebook tailored for regular intervals. Instead, we utilize the PT-codebook and PS-codebook mechanisms, which assign codes based on timestamp and node index information, irrespective of sampling frequency. Coupled with attention mechanisms that do not depend on temporal sequence, these adaptations ensure ReCTSi seamlessly accommodates irregularly sampled data.

In conclusion, ReCTSi is theoretically capable of handling noisy or irregularly sampled data with minimal modifications, yet exploring this is beyond this paper's scope.
### Q6/W1 (Hyperparameter Study):
Within ReCTSi, there are four main hyperparameters: embedding size, window size, CaA block number, and total codebook size. In the original submission, we have presented the hyperparameter studies of the most important hyperparameters: embedding size and window size in Fig.5. 

Besides, through extensive experiments, we suggest limiting the CaA block number to one or two for optimal performance in the caption of Figure 3. We have added the additional hyper-parameter study$^\S$ of the CaA block number, with one block yielding an MAE of 19.48 on AQ36. Increasing the CaA block number to two or three resulted in higher MAEs of 21.23 and 26.64, respectively. Regarding the total codebook size, our findings indicate a relative insensitivity due to the PCF's compression capabilities. Even with larger codebook sizes, the model maintains stable accuracy (MAE ranging from 19.483 to 20.659 with total codebook size from 24 to 120 on AQ36), as redundant information is efficiently condensed.

Based on these results, we recommend an embedding size comparable to the dataset's channel count for adequate expressiveness and suggest limiting CaA blocks to one or two. A larger initial codebook size is advisable, with PCF ensuring efficient compression. These practical guidelines for configuring ReCTSi will be included in the final version.
### W3 (Balance of Accuracy and Resource Efficiency):
We acknowledge the critical trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. ReCTSi is designed to achieve SOTA performance in both aspects. The experimental results, as detailed in Tables 1 and 2, show that ReCTSi not only consistently achieves SOTA accuracy, ranking top-1 in 14 out of 15 accuracy metrics across five datasets and securing top-2 in all accuracy metrics, but also offers significant resource efficiency. This balance makes ReCTSi particularly compelling for applications where both accuracy and efficiency are critical.
